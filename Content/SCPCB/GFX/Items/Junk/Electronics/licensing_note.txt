This is where it came from, it's not listed under CC but it seems like we can use it for free.
That being said, it would be nice to replace this with something we can license under CC-BY-SA 3.0.
The website is dead now and there's no way we could buy it since it seems like this site shipped
optical media with purchases.

There's also no hope of reaching out to the guy who ran the website; his personal website is also
dead and there's no way googling "Will Smith" will get us the right guy.

However, we know what the content of the texture actually is: it's a Sound Blaster Vibra 128, model
CT4810. If we really wanted to replace this with a CC version, we could easily get our hands on
another of these cards and take a new picture. We could also just grab any random old PCB and use
that, since this texture is supposed to be generic.
